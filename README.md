# Introduction
This project is to create a website for my World of Warcraft guild, Solarian League and can be found at [Solarian League](https://www.solarianleague.com)]
The source content for the Website will primarily be pulled from the World of Warcraft website.

# Purpose
This is a personal project so that I can improve in my front-end UI development skills in web development.
I will be using Blazor C# and WebAssembly as the framework for the development project.
My focus for this project is mostly front-end and I will likely not spend a lot of time on backend code.

## Key focus areas of study for this project include:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Blazor C# Web Assembly

# Getting Started
1. Visual Studio 2022
2. .NET 8 SDK
3. npm install -g @azure/static-web-apps-cli

## Resources
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) Example usage in NavMenu.razor.css, look for 'bi-plus-square-fill-nav-menu', copy svg code into css style.
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

# Build and Test
Building of the project will be done through Visual Studio 2022.
I am not planning on using any testing frameworks at this time, the focus here is to learn the basics of web development.
