# Introduction
This project is to create a website for my World of Warcraft guild, Solarian League and can be found at [Solarian League](https://www.solarianleague.com)
The source content for the Website will primarily be pulled from the World of Warcraft website.

# Purpose
This is a personal project so that I can improve in my front-end UI development skills in web development.
I will be using Blazor C# and WebAssembly as the framework for the development project.
My focus for this project is mostly front-end and I will likely not spend a lot of time on backend code.

## Key focus areas of study for this project include:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Blazor C# Web Assembly

# Getting Started
1. Visual Studio 2022 or VSCode
2. .NET 8 SDK
3. Install func-cli-x64.msi
4. npm install -g @azure/static-web-apps-cli

# Build and Test
Building of the project will be done through Visual Studio 2022 for now, however automation will be configured later.
I am not planning on using any testing frameworks at this time, the focus here is to learn the basics of web development.
