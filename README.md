# Introduction
This project is to create a website for my World of Warcraft guild, Solarian League.


# Purpose
This entire website is a learning project for me to learn the basics of web development.
I have little prior experience in web development, so this is a great way for me to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I will also be using Blazor C# Webassembly to learn the basics of C# web development.

## Key focus areas of study for this project include:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Blazor C# Webassembly

# Getting Started
1.	Visual Studio 2022
2.	.NET 8 SDK
3.	Source content for Solarian League Website will primarily be pulled from the World of Warcraft website.

# Build and Test
Building of the project will be done through Visual Studio 2022.
I am not planning on using any testing frameworks at this time, the focus here is to learn the basics of web development.
